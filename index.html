            <p data-aos="fade-right">In this project I was tasked to create an HTML/CSS Landing page for an application designed and built for a Non-Profit organization from scratch. I was given 3 days and 3 hours of development time(27 total work hours).
I decided to add a few re-usable JavaScript components to add some interactivity to the webpage. The reason I am proud of this page for multiple reasons, not the least of which being that it was for a good cause.
In particular I am proud of the work I had done on creating a rather versatile Infinite scroll carousel that functioned autonomously based on a timer, or with user interaction from scratch with some clean and subtle greensock animations from scratch.

P.S. Type "adamswatching" or "adamapproves" anywhere in the window to see the hidden Easter Egg.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-right">In this application I was tasked with building a SPA(Single Page Application) around data I was receiving from a data science team from scratch using CRA. This data was on gun violence in the US and was given 3 days and 3 hours of development time(27 total work hours).
We used it to create interactive heat maps for the previous 4 years of data, highlighting  by county, and state the frequency at which gun violence occurred in certain areas.
I found this to be so interesting to bring in a heat map based on each years statistics, but also an aggregate model for the last previous 4 years.
On the technical side I was most excited to learn about and figure out an solid implementation of Plot.ly a tool that I used to render the data models into iframes that I could then map over and render from with in my application.</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-right">On this project I was tasked with building a RESTful API for an application that served quotes from the popular animated series "The Simpsons" from scratch built with Knex.js and Express.js. I was given 3 days and 3 hours of development time(27 total work hours).
The purpose of the application was to provide users with a location to search for and store favorited quotes from the series if they chose to register with the app.
We also had a data science team that produced an AI based algorithm that would generate 10 random quotes given one of the shows characters.
I decided with the simplicity of the application and the server architecture I would do something fun and extra. Based on that thought I taught myself MarkDown,  APIDocs.js, and surge.sh for hosting. I also implemented extra role based authentication to the server for practice as well as a few more peices of custom middle-ware including from scratch JSON Web Token authentication.</p>
